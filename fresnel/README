This directory contains files for looking at n layer system using the
Fresnel relations.

fftwiggles.m      fresnel reflection/scattering amplitude for different
                  propagation distances as a function of a spatial
									coordinate
fresnelkspace.m   fresnel reflection/scattering amplitude as a fucnction of
                  k or angle
nlayerfresnel.m   solves the complex n layer Fresnel relations
