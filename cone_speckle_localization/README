This is a makefile C code which simulates one moving scatterer in a fixed scatterers plan.

* In order to run programme a basic Scatterers.txt file is needed.This Scatterers.txt file is produced by another C code -- random_scatterers_creater, which will give us a position matrix of a fixed number of scatterers' positions.

* As out-put, several files will be created.
	** 'Scatterers_x_moving.txt' and 'Scatterers_y_moving.txt',which contain 	the sets of positions of the scatterers.

	** 'visting_counter_moving.txt', which contains the sets of the visting 	counting for each scatterer.

Here we define that one "set" means one position of the moving scatterer.If the moving scatterer has 100 positions, then the 'Scatterer_*_moving.txt' and 'visting_counter_moving.txt' should also have 100 corresponing sets.

* Using the matlab code 'one_moving_scatterer.m', it is possible to create a .gif picture to see the localization in multiple scattering with one moving scatterer.
