This is a makefile C code for creating the cone shape speckle pattern. 

* In order to run programme a basic Scatterers.txt file is needed.This Scatterers.txt file is produced by another C code -- random_scatterers_creater, which will give us a position matrix of a fixed number of scatterers' positions.

* There are several out-put file for this program.
	** a .h5 file which contains the cone speckle pattern. Using the command 	'h5topng' this file can be changed into .png file to view.
	
	** a 'visting counting.txt' file which contains the information of the 
	radiation counting for every scatterer. Using this .txt file, an localiz	ation drawing can be done by the matlab codes.

	** a 'free_path.txt' file which contains the accumulated path for each i	teration in the program. Using the matlab code, an exponenatial decade f	uction with the information of mean-free-path as the expectation.
