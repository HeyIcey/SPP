This matlab is to create a polar graph of the coherent back scattering. 

- In the cbs_localization_sets.m, the program will create NSET sets of localization sets which will create the polar graph. The position of the localization is determined by the randn number generator. The output is the polar graph of light amplitude distribution, not the intensity.

- In cbs_polar.m is a single set of localization.
